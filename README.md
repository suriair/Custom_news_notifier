# Custom_news_notifier

This is a raw project for scrapping the news and links from the swarajmag.com tecnology section and creating a desktop notifier.

In order to use the code you have to install certain python libraries first are as follows:-
1. beautifulsoup
2. notifypy

This is a non-production based project developed for learning and clearing the concepts, so it maybe doen't look fasinating to you.

Enjoy, Thanks!
